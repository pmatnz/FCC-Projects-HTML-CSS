var namyName ="Paul"; //this is a javascript variable
/* if you declare a variable with no value it will be undefined, if you do an operation to an undefined variable it will return NaN = not a number*/

let dogsName = "Max"; // a let variable can only be declared once unlike usine var, best common pratice to use let in javascript

const catsName = "Maisy" /* using const has the same impact as let but it can no longer be charged again, it will retain "Maisy" forver unless const is changed, 
This means they are unmutable , can't be changed. Common practice is to also name any const variables in all capitals const MYVAR */

myVar = 10; myVar++; // ++ will add 1 to the original value of myVar, same with -- it will takeaway 1
